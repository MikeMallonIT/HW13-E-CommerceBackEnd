# Homework 13 - ORM: E-Commerce Back End - Michael Mallon

## What I did

This week I used Express.js to build an E-Comerce back end database with an API for the Insomnia client to interact with. I built Models and Routes to organize and serve up the data stored in an SQL database. I wrote PUSH, PUT, GET and DELETE routes for modifying the three different types of data. 

<br>

### Motivation:
This application was the first step twards a true client/ server web application. I practiced my ability to write node js syntax

<br>

### Problems I solved:
    * Built Models for standaized data types
    * Built routes to serve data from server-sied SQL database
    * Used Insomnia as front end client
    * Modified index.js file in models folder so models can reference eachother

<br />
