# Homework 13 - ORM: E-Commerce Back End - Michael Mallon

## What I did

This week I used My SQL to build a database and application that modifies the database from the CLI. The Employee tracker uses node.js to run JavaScript in the command line and inquirer to ask users for information


<br>

### Motivation:
This application was a great refresher on SQL. Database is one of the key aspects of fullstack and this assignment helped me better understand how JavaScript interacts with databases

<br>

### Problems I solved:
    * Built appropriate file system 
    * Used inquirer to request user input in the CLI
    * Built SQL Database with multiple tables
    * Called various SQL functions to add, change and delete data

<br />
<br />

## Installation:
Download all associated files in this repository. Install Node.js then use the `npm install` function. After that, CD to the directory the root application folder is installed in and use the `node index.js` function.

### See screenshots for assistance with install and functionality:
